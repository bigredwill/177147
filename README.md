2^11 = 2048

3^11 = 177147
======

Basically 2048 in three dimensions.  I chose 3^11 = 177147 as the name, but since refactoring my code the cube dimension can be as big as computationally allowable.

Todo:
  1. Add GUI. This includes score, new game setup, misc info, etc.
  2. Clean up code. (I learned THREEjs and working with 3d graphics while doing this, so some sections are a little messy).

If you see anything you'd like to fix please send a pull request! This was a learning project, so please help me learn :)
