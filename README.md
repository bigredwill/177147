A 3D cube slider game, inspired by Threes and 2048.

Basically Threes in three dimensions.  I initially chose 3^11 = 177147 as the name, but the numbers became too large and scary when squaring them so now it's just adding them.  The name should be 3*11 = 33.




If you see anything you'd like to fix please send a pull request! This was a learning project, so please help me learn :)
###Todo:
  
  1. Clean up code. (I learned THREEjs and working with 3d graphics while doing this, so some sections are a little messy).
